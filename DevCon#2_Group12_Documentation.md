**“The King and the Fool” - Design Documentation**

**Overview:**

_The King and the Fool_ is a puzzle platformer game with a new twist on the typical conventions of the genre, in that it offers the player the ability to possess a wide range of household objects in their quest to escape the place they are trapped within, and reunite the fragments of their shattered soul. As a fragment of the soul of a Divine Emperor, you do not have a corporeal body, but who's to say you can't utilize the objects around you to get things done? After all, you still have _some_ divine power, and the High Lords would sooner destroy Jantris than wait until you return to force them into submission. 

**Objective:**

We seek to create a puzzle platformer game that tasks the player with utilizing not just the toolset of _one_ character, but the varied toolsets offered by the _variety_ of household objects that you can possess and manipulate. Each object will provide different abilities, and will play a different role in the player's escape, so the player must use the different objects creatively to solve various problems that will culminate with their escape from the house they are initially trapped in. What we are really trying to test here is: How does shifting between objects change player engagement and level navigation, and does possession encourage creative solutions and strategies compared to conventional models of control with just one character. 

One single character is straightforward, and provides a solid, defined set of options for the player, but having multiple different "bodies" that the player can inhabit - that also remain in the world when not actively in use - provides a range of new options, even beyond the sum of the individual abilities or functions of the objects. We think this could provide some very interesting possibilities with regards to level design, and freeform problem solving, and so this prototype serves to explore the potential present in these ideas. 

**Design Rationale**

Most games tend to lock players into one "body" or one way of experiencing the world of the game. Even when they give players some variety, it's usually in the form of switching between characters who mostly play the same way (ie; If you're playing a hack 'n' slash game, chances are that the alternate characters also play similarly to the starting character, even if they have a different playstyle or role, gameplay-wise). This game would seek to use possession as a main mechanic, rather than as a temporary ability, so as to give the player a _far_ greater range of options with how they can interact with the game world, how they can solve problems, or otherwise just how they can experience the game.

The range of possession targets could run the gamut, so to speak, and could provide the player with multiple different valid ways of solving a puzzle. Our main player experience goal here is to create moments where players have to think of the objects in the room as unique tools that can help them accomplish their task rather than just as useless props.

**Core Gameplay:**

The core gameplay of _The King and the Fool_ involves possessing different objects, and using their unique traits and properties to solve problems, and ultimately, escape the room they are initially trapped within. 

**Core Mechanics:**

- **Possession**

- The one single main mechanic with this game is Possession, where the player can take over a range of different items that will each perform differently, and occupy different roles in the player's 'toolbox'. It is hard to describe the specifics of this mechanic, as each object will perform differently, but in general, this mechanic will allow the player to control _most_ objects that would normally be random, insignificant props in other games. Each prop will have a general behavior depending on the type of object, and then may also have different unique mechanics to them, depending on what they are and what makes sense for that object.
 
  There are generaly three types of objects: Stationary Objects, Boolean Objects, and Interactible Control Objects.

- Stationary Objects: These objects can be possessed, and then used to move towards a goal. (ex: crates)

- Boolean Objects: These objects can be turned on or off through possession. (ex: lights)
        
- Interactible Control Objects: These objects can move or tip slightly when possessed, and can be used to traverse to another puzzle element.

**Narrative Hook:**

Ancient tales tell of sorcerors, wizards, knights, dragons and more, however these are but tall tales told to entertain children, or scare them into obedience. Few tell of the truths buried deep within these legends, and even fewer still tell the true grisly details about the dark powers that warred upon the mortal plane long ago. While those who lived through it are long dead, the history is long forgotten, and in the modern age it is regarded as mere fiction, there are grains of truth laying within even the modern tales that paint a dark picture, laying out the reality of how the world's fate rested on the knife's edge for a time.  

Many tens of thousands of years ago, the world was dominated by a vast and powerful kingdom known as Jantris. Ruled by the Divine Emperor of Jantris, the _true_ Wheel-Turning King, Ophiucius Tyrodin, and guided by the Seven High Lords of Jantris, each a divine being in their own right, the kingdom was prosperous, and stable. While conflict between the High Lords was relatively common, Emperor Tyrodin used his sheer might to reign in the High Lords and force their submission to his divine will. Through his power, peace was maintained, and threats to the realm were vanquished one by one. As though it may as well have been the center of all reality itself, Jantris would become the crown jewel of the mortal plane, the true seat of power in the mortal realm. It was a perfect, unblemished utopia, and represented the greatest golden age ever witnessed by mortal eyes.

Unfortunately, as with anything seeking perfection, the closer one gets to achieving it, the more striking even a single blemish may appear. After ruling this perfect, idealized realm for an eternity, without a warning or even so much as a trace, Emperor Tyrodin would shock the entire kingdom to its core by suddenly disappearing at a critical moment of strife among the High Lords. With his disappearance emerged the power vacuum to end all power vacuums, and it didn't take long for the power-hungry High Lords to begin fighting over conrol of Jantris. As with all legends, there is little certainty, but it has often been said that Tyrodin was not _always_ a divine entity, and rumors have long circulated that he was once a mortal man who ascended to divinity upon taking his place on the Throne of Jantris. The High Lords truly could not confirm or deny this, as Tyrodin was always a secretive individual, even among allies, but the Seven were convinced that the secret to the Emperor's might laid within the Throne itself. 

With the throne vacant, Tyrodin nowhere to be found, and the greatest power vacuum in history beginning to form, the Kingdom would soon erupt into total, all-out warfare, with each of the Seven seeking to claim the throne for themselves. Whether it was the prideful Grand Duke of Feldspar, Ventriel, the mad lord of the Dominion of the Blade King, Excisitus, or the avaricious High Guildmaster of Syderia, Belphegor, amongst others, all sought to claim the Throne of Jantris, and were willing to raze heaven and earth to seize it for themselves. The High Lords were each gifted with supreme divine power, the power to create and shape the world as they saw fit, yet in their frenzied state, they would wield this supreme divine power in the same way a man may wield an especially sharp rock. These Wheel-Turning Kings, each a mighty lord with armies capable of laying continents to waste, once kept restrained by the presence of the Divine Emperor, have ruthlessly turned their weapons on each other.

Unfortunately for all those in Jantris, the Mad Lords will not cease their fighting until either only one remains, or there is no Jantris left for them to rule. Only one may be granted divinity upon ascension to the Throne, and, in their arrogance, the High Lords will either smash the Wheel, merely perpetuating the cycle for eons longer, or one among them will ascend to become the _true_ Wheel-Turning King: 

_The Chakravartin._

Unbeknownst to the High Lords, however, the Emperor was not truly gone. There was one last thing that the Emperor needed to do in order to achieve the _true_ perfection he sought. In an effort to ascend past the limitations of the Mortal and Divine planes, Tyrodin would resort to dark and obscure forms of magic, and in the process, would make a _grave_ mistake. The Divine Emperor, despite being a brilliant strategist, able to outwit and outmaneuver even the Seven, would find himself having been _tricked_. Having sought out numerous methods of ascension for eons himself, none of Tyrodin's methods were successful until he encountered an ancient-beyond-ancient tome known as _"The King and the Fool"._ The tome told a story, a fairly unremarkable tale of a King's court, but hidden deep within the particulars of the ancient language of the book existed ancient words of power that could be used to awaken the dormant strength stored within the tome. After taking the tome back to his palace at the heart of Jantris, Tyrodin would study the book and eventually manage to decode it. Soon after, he would attempt to harness the power offered by the book. Though something in his mind kept telling him to stop, to not continue with the book, and to cast it into flames of creation itself, Tyrodin could not bring himself to stop when he believed he was so close to his goal. 

Upon unsealing the power contained within, the Emperor would be hit by a sensation he had not felt for a _very_ long time. _Mortality._ More than that. _Something_ had a hold of him. A hold of his _soul._ A few moments later, it all clicked. As powerful as the Divine Emperor and the Seven were, they were merely the gods of the mortal plane, barely even demi-gods compared to the true deities of the highest layers of reality. Tyrodin had scorned the God of Fate, and this was his punishment. _The Fool_ knew all along that the King would attempt to overstep his bounds, and laid a trap in advance, deciding that he needed to be taught a lesson. In an instant, what was once the single, unified soul of The Divine Emperor of Jantris became a trillion tiny shards, scattering through the cosmic winds like the leaves of a tree in the autumn breeze. 

With the Emperor's soul scattered to the cosmic winds, spreading out through space _and_ time, and all of Jantris at war, the history of this time becomes murky, and nearly impossible to track. What _is_ certain is that a fragment of the Emperor's great soul has arrived in our time. What you must know is that _you_ are that fragment, whether or not you understand this at the moment. If you ever hope to reclaim the power you once wielded, you _must_ escape this place, and find a way to reunite the fragments of your soul. If you cannot, the Seven will destroy Jantris, and everything you sought to build will crumble to dust. Escape this place, reunite the fragments of your soul, and reclaim your position as the true Wheel-Turning King!
