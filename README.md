**Team:** Jake, Blair, Sergio  

# Introduction:

You awaken in a void. You can't feel your body. Your mind is foggy, and you struggle to concentrate. Focus. _Focus._ You will not cease to be here, in this un-place. But who are you? _What_ are you? How did you end up here?

Time passes, but with such clouded senses, and no way to mark the time, you have no idea if a minute has passed, or if several thousand years have passed. You drift in and out of consciousness.

Suddenly, a faint light appears. You are being pulled towards it. Even if you had the strength to resist, it would be pointless. It is though space itself is curving so as to pull you towards this light.

You fall further and further towards the light, and as you do, its luminosity grows. Faster and faster, the light gets brighter and brighter. You feel cold, and the sensation of falling, but still nothing beyond that. Why? Why can't you feel anything? 

You do not have time to find the answer before you are pulled into the center of this blindingly bright light. The moment you make contact, you are pulled into an even-further-between realm, and begin to feel . . . everything?

As if every possible sensation hits you at once, you feel _everything._ It is intensely _overwhelming._ Just as you think you are about to lose what is left of your mind, it all ceases, and you black out. 

Some time later, you awaken in . . . a room? Is this a bedroom of some sort? It looks nothing like any room you have seen before, but you can still identify enough of it to make out what its function is. 

You still cannot feel your body, but _something_ has changed. You remember something, somehow. A fragment of an old life perhaps? 

You try to concentrate on the memory, and before you even realize, an intensely vivid memory washes over you. A variety of feelings wash over you as the memory does.

Pride. Strength. Exhaustion. _Fear._ 

 You can't put it all together, but from what you can glean, your past life was one of strength, skill, and power. You were strong, but you made an error. An error that has left you in your current state. As punishment for this error, you were shattered. What you are now is but a fragment of what you once were, but maybe . . . just maybe, if you can gather up these shattered fragments, you can regain your former strength. 

 Eventually, in the midst of trying to recall your memories, you notice a faint, dull sensation, and it snaps you back to reality. What _was_ that? 

 You look around. The room looks the same, but something feels off. 

 That's when it hits you. 

 You are no longer in your original body. You are occupying . . . some sort of bottle? _What?_ How can this be? _You are somehow inhabiting a bottle of . . . some kind of beverage?_ You struggle against the confines of this "body" you are inhabiting, and notice that you are somehow able to move around. 
 
 You think, perhaps if you concentrate, you may be able to even shift your essence _out_ of this body, and into something else.

 "I don't know what I am exactly, or why I am here, but I know I cannot stay here. I _must_ make myself whole again. I refuse to allow myself to dissolve in this . . . absurd place!" you say as you begin the monumental task of reforging your soul, and finding a way home . . .
 
# Description:

_The King and the Fool_ is a puzzle-platformer game where you play as a single lost fragment of a mysterious and powerful figure whose very essence was shattered into trillions of pieces, and scattered across time and space. Your goal: Escape. Reforge your very being. Reclaim what was taken from you. In this game, you will utilize your power of possession to possess a wide variety of objects that you must utilize to solve problems, reach objectives, and ultimately, reunite the shattered fragments of your soul. To succeed, be creative, and think outside the box! (Think _inside_ the box too, because you may very well _become_ the box!) 

(Note: This is a proof of concept prototype made to examine how shifting between objects affects player engagement and level navigation, and how well the possession mechanic encourages creative solutions and strategies compared to conventional models of control with just one character.)

# Controls:
